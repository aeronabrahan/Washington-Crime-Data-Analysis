## Problem Statement
Crime data is often vast, complex, and difficult to interpret, making it challenging for policymakers, law enforcement, and communities to make data-driven decisions. Understanding when, where, and how crimes occur is essential to improving crime prevention, resource allocation, and public safety.

---

## Objective
This Washington Crime Dashboard was built to analyze crime trends, severity, and geographical distribution to help:
1. Identify crime patterns by time, location, and type.
2. Measure crime severity using UCR rankings.
3. Assess police efficiency through crime clearance rates.
4. Pinpoint high-crime neighborhoods using geospatial analysis.
5. Provide actionable insights for crime prevention and safety measures.

## Dashboard Design
The Washington Crime Dashboard is structured into four pages, each focusing on specific crime insights.

### Home Page
Purpose: Provides an overview of key crime metrics at a glance.
- KPI Cards: Total Crimes, Crime Rate, Weapon-Related Crimes, Average Resolution Time.
- Visuals:
  - Crime Trends by Time of Day (Line Chart)
  - Top 5 Most Common Crime Types (Bar Chart)
  - Top 10 Crime Hotspots (Treemap)
- Key Takeaways & Recommendations section.

### Crime Trends
Purpose: Analyzes how crime patterns change over time.
- Visuals:
  - How Crime Trends Change Over Time (Line Chart)
  - How Crime Types Have Changed Over Time (Stacked Column Chart)
  - Are Crimes Being Solved Faster Over Time? (Line & Bar Chart)
- KPI Cards:
  - Daily Average Crimes Reported
  - Most Frequently Reported Crime
  - % of Crimes Occurring at Night

### Geographical Analysis
Purpose: Visualizes crime distribution using maps.
- Visuals:
  - ArcGIS Heatmap (Crime Hotspots)
  - Crime Rate by Police Service Area (Card)
  - Most Common Crime in Selected Area (Card)
  - Highest Crime Neighborhood (Card)

### Crime Severity & Resolution
Purpose: Evaluates the severity of crimes and their resolution rates.
- Visuals:
  - Crime Severity Index by Crime Type (Bar Chart)
  - Crime Rate by Police District (Bar Chart)
  - Crime Resolution Status by Crime Type (Bar Chart)
- KPI Cards:
  - Most Severe Crime Type
  - Crime Severity Index

## Codes Used (DAX Measures)
Below are the DAX measures used in the dashboard, along with their purposes.

### Crime Trend & Overview Measures
- `_Total_Crimes` â†’ Counts total crime incidents.
- `_Crime_Rate` â†’ Measures crime rate per 1,000 people.
- `_Crimes_by_Time_of_Day` â†’ Summarizes crimes based on shift (Midnight, Day, Evening).
- `_Top_5_Crime_Types` â†’ Identifies the most frequent crime types.

### Geographical Analysis Measures
- `_Crimes_in_Selected_Area` â†’ Counts crimes in a selected police district.
- `_Crimes_Per_PSA` â†’ Calculates crime density per Police Service Area.
- `_Most_Common_Crime_Selected_Area` â†’ Finds the top crime type in a filtered area.
- `_Top_Crime_Neighborhood` â†’ Identifies the highest crime neighborhood.

### Crime Severity & Resolution Measures
- `_Crime_Severity_Index` â†’ Weighs crimes based on severity rankings.
- `_Crime_Clearance_Rate` â†’ Calculates the percentage of resolved cases.
- `_Resolution_Time` â†’ Averages the number of days it takes to resolve a case.
- `_Crime_Resolution_Rate_Per_District` â†’ Measures resolution rates by police district.

---

## Analysis & Insights
### Key Takeaways
- Crimes peak in the evening, with Theft/Other being the most reported crime.
- Clusters 2, 23, and 25 report the highest crime rates.
- 92.66% of cases are resolved, but violent crimes take longer to resolve.
- Weapon-related crimes pose a significant safety risk in some areas.

### Recommendations
- Enhance anti-theft measures: Since property crimes dominate, authorities should increase surveillance in high-risk areas.
- Improve response time: Crimes with longer resolution times may require additional investigative resources.
- Community awareness: Education and stricter monitoring can help reduce firearm-related incidents.
